# Hyphenator-clj

A re-implementation of a hyphenation algorithm I originally implemented in [PHP](https://github.com/nikonyrh/hyphenator-php/).
Just started learning the language a few days ago before I started writing this so it might be a mess.

I'll try to make this a general-purpose library but I don't know how to do that yet. Meanwhile you can try
feeding it command-line arguments and see its output. Rules for excluding too short tokens aren't implemented yet.
